   INSTALLATION
   ------------
   
It is very easy to install pygrep. The only thing you have to do is to
download it whereever you want and then to make an script like this:

--
#!/bin/bash
/complete/path/to/pygrep/pygrep.py
--

It has a bug in the Paths library, so it can find the .glade only if
you do it so. If you know how to solve it, please, tell me.
